					There are many mobile applications have been implemented to reduce the difficulties they face when travelling and organizing the memories. Most of them have considered the metadata for this purpose while we are going to use the content based data for the recognizing and retrieval as it is more accurate. The accommodations and the real time update of the place. And for the person who is going to upload an image to the application, they can get a feedback of others too. Most importantly this data exchange is encrypted

<summary> 01 : A Visual Landmark Recognition System for Topological Navigation of Mobile Robots</summary> <br>
<p>This research describes a vision-based landmark recognition system for use with mobile robot navigation tasks. A search algorithm based on genetic techniques for pattern recognition in digital images is presented. The developed system allows the topological localization of a mobile robot using natural and artificial landmarks. Text strings inside landmarks can be read and interpreted, if present. The resulting system has been tested onboard a B21 mobile robot and proved useful. The presented experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Project 02 : Fast Online Learning Algorithm for Landmark Recognition based on Bow Framework</summary>
	<br> 
	<p> 
It proposes a quick web based learning system for Landmark acknowledgment in light of single shrouded layer feed forward neural systems (SLFNs). Ordinary Landmark acknowledgment structures by and large accept that all pictures are accessible within reach to prepare the classifier. Nonetheless, in certifiable applications, individuals may experience the issue that the classifier based on the current historic point dataset should be tuned when new milestone pictures are gathered. To address this issue, a quick online consecutive learning structure in view of the current extraordinary learning machine (ELM) which can refresh the classifier by taking in the new pictures one-by-one or lump by-piece is produced for the point of interest acknowledgment. The current spatial pyramid kernel bag-of-words (bow) technique is utilized for the element.

Project 03 : City-Scale Landmark Identification on Mobile Devices</summary>
<br> <p>
With recent advances in mobile computing, the demand for visual localization or landmark identification on mobile devices is gaining interest. We advance the state of the art in this area by fusing two popular representations of street level image data—facade-aligned and viewpoint-aligned and show that they contain complementary information that can be exploited to significantly improve the recall rates on the city scale. We also improve feature detection in low contrast parts of the street-level data, and discuss how to incorporate priors on a user’s position (e.g. given by noisy GPS readings or network cells), which previous approaches often ignore.

Project 4: RMI for mobile behavior</summary>
<br><p>
RMI can move behavior (class implementations) from client to server and server to client. For example, you can define an interface for examining employee expense reports to see whether they conform to current company policy. When an expense report is created, an object that implements that interface can be fetched by the client from the server. When the policies change, the server will start returning a different implementation of that interface that uses the new policies. The constraints will therefore be checked on the client side-providing faster feedback to the user and less load on the server-without installing any new software on user's system. This gives you maximal flexibility, since changing policies requires you to write only one new Java class and install it once on the server host.

				<h4 class=" mt-4 text-uppercase">Research Gap</h4>
				<p class="mt-4"> We are in a need of well-designed solution that would allow us to use a single standardized 
					System for Landmark recognition and Retrieval in World. In the current available system can identify 
					and give the location. They used Google Map by using mobile devices for this purpose. Also they divide 
					segments in input image compare their database and show them what that landmark is.In current system like 
					Google Goggles – Search by taking a picture: point your mobile phone camera at a painting, a famous landmark, 
					a barcode or QR code, a product, or a popular image. If Goggles finds it in its database, it will provide 
					you with useful information (name, country)


Present system does not have recognize the landmark images by using pixels. They only compare that input image is same as 
there data base image and retrieve it. Also they are not Consider several human features.  From the survey that has to be 
filled by the user and predict the places according to that particular area. We mainly focused on those issues and came up 
with better solution for that system with high reliability, better accuracy.

				<h4 class=" mt-4 text-uppercase">Research Problem</h4>
				<p class="mt-4"> As mentioned earlier, there are major problems with the current system. When we see some images of 
					place that we are interest of visiting or go for some more images on that same landmark but the image 
					retrieval is fundamental problem in computer vision make a barrier to retrieve the image with correct 
					landmark from large databases.

Also if we have any collection of images where we visited while ago but no extract memory right now like what is the name of 
this temple I visited? Who created this monument I saw in there? And also we are curious of the more details on that monument 
or the temple.  Build models that recognize the correct landmark (if any) in a dataset is challenging task. Then Consider several 
features from the survey that has to be filled by the user and predict the places according to that particular area.

				<p class="mt-4"> The proposed system consists of a mobile application mostly focused on tourists and it will 
					be even helpful for the tour guides. Mobile application interacts with travelers who likes to 
					find the details of the particular image details that contain landmarks. This application is 
					connected via cloud server to connect with inbuilt Restful server in our application. In addition 
					to that it implements an image processing system to capture the landmarks to identify and gather 
					the details of the landmark by using OpenCV library and python. Also the system is capable of 
					customizing the user experience by using the profiling technique we implement with Twitter.
